TODO

Please complete Assessment [GH10] 'Full Stack Application' prepared by Alex Arditti: Task:
• Create a basic React social media site that mimics Instagram or a film database application .

• [x] Use the OMDb API or similar API to randomly grab images and render them using the map() method.

• [x] Create a REST API that allows for user login and auth.

• [x] Connect front-end and back-end with fetch requests.
  - movie search function works
  - listusers works


-- Some of the following notes may need updating/deleting:



[] Stretch Goal - Host application using Heroku + Netlify.

  React app

Create account [x] 
  partially done - the signup.js form creates a new account the in database!
Login html response [x] working "user" logged in
Delete account []
List users [x] 
  partially done - needs styling and conditional rendering via a button.

Conditional rendering?

Sign up form.


{/* Q 1: Why isn't my signup component rendering?

Q 2: Is my signup form working with the database once it's rendered? If not how do I fix it?
Q 3: Code example for conditional rendering e.g. sign up form not
visible until user presses a signup button  */}

utils/index.js - these are the functions e.g. signup that interact with the REST API server.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
