  React app

Create account [x] 
  partially done - the signup.js form creates a new account the in database!
Login html response [x] working "user" logged in
Delete account []
List users [x] 
  partially done - needs styling and conditional rendering via a button.

Conditional rendering?

Sign up form.
I'm going to do it with routes if I don't figure out conditional rendering quickly.


{/* Q 1: Why isn't my signup component rendering?

Q 2: Is my signup form working with the database once it's rendered? If not how do I fix it?
Q 3: Code example for conditional rendering e.g. sign up form not
visible until user presses a signup button  */}

utils/index.js - these are the functions e.g. signup that interact with the REST API server.
